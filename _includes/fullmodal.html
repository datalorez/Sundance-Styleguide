          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>During the month-long Directors Lab, eight Fellows work with an accomplished group of Creative Advisors and professional production crews, rehearsing, shooting, and editing key scenes from their scripts. Through this intense, hands-on process, the Fellows workshop scenes, collaborate with actors, and find a visual language for their film in an atmosphere where experimentation and risk-taking is encouraged. Directors Lab Fellows also join in the week-long Screenwriters Lab with five additional projects, participating in individualized story sessions under the guidance of established screenwriters. 2016 Directing Fellows recently shared advice they received at the Lab with Indiewire. Additionally Fellows, Eva Vives, CÃ©sar Cervantes and Sandhya Suri contributed pieces about their experience.</p>
